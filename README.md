# CartPole-Balancing-using-DQN-with-Animation
This project uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart
in the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns an optimal policy through Reinforcement
Learning, by using interacting with the environment, storing experiences in replay memory, and updating its
neural network using Q-learning and a 3-layer neural network.The trained agentâ€™s performance is visualized
with real-time animation, and training progress is tracked via episode reward plots.
