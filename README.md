# CartPole-Balancing-using-DQN-with-Animation
This project applies a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent for the CartPole-v1 task, using Reinforcement Learning, experience replay and a 3-layer neural network. The agentâ€™s learning progress is tracked with reward plots and visualized through real-time animation.
